# June 14th: design the draft.

So I just can't believe I finished all design in one day, kind of.

I was so impressed by everyone in the call this morning that I decided to give hackpad a go.

So, I followed the tutorial and changed it a little bit. Overall, that was an quick design.

This is my second time designing a PCB, kinda getting used to it.

and also the do the case, but I think it's a failure, probably I'll have to design it again.

**Total time spent: 8h**

# June 15th: Fix some design parts.

Today I drew a new design of the case.

I calculated the height so the screw will fit.

**Total time spent: 5h**

# June 16th: Realign the model parts.

I think the alignment have a little bit, I mean a big trouble, so I went back to Kicad and remeasured the lengths and calculate again the measurements.

To my surprise, almost none of the alignment are actually aligned, so I just fix them all, hopefully with some sweat...

# June 18th: final fix and get approved.

I add the PCB to the cad and submit it for approval.

**Total time spent: 2h**

# June 20th: Place order.

I send the PCB into production. Well, got stuck with the coupon problem for a while

# June 22th: Got a call from delivery

So, I live in Taiwan, a place that has strict rule on Chinese products.

I just got a call from the delivery company to ask me for real name verification, I was first shock that I have to do this just to get my PCB. I mean, why the hack should I need to verify who I am, it's just a PCB.

So, I got to verify and it didn't went so well. Well, it turns out that my SIM card cannot connect to mobil network, which prevents me from even registering. So after some talk with the customer service, I used my family's phone to verify. 

That was freaking tedious, but after all, I somehow got it to work.

**Total time spent: 1h**
