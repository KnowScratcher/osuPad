# June 14th: design the draft.

So I just can't believe I finished all design in one day, kind of.

I was so impressed by everyone in the call this morning that I decided to give hackpad a go.

So, I followed the tutorial and changed it a little bit. Overall, that was an quick design.

This is my second time designing a PCB, kinda getting used to it.

and also the do the case, but I think it's a failure, probably I'll have to design it again.

**Total time spent: 8h**

# June 15th: Fix some design parts.

Today I drew a new design of the case.

I calculated the height so the screw will fit.

**Total time spent: 5h**

# June 16th: Realign the model parts.

I think the alignment have a little bit, I mean a big trouble, so I went back to Kicad and remeasured the lengths and calculate again the measurements.

To my surprise, almost none of the alignment are actually aligned, so I just fix them all, hopefully with some sweat...
