# BOM
Because I live in Taiwan, so I'll add a TWD column.

# Journal
The journal is in [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md)

A brief summery of the journal:

## How it all started

I was on a meeting with hack club hackers, and I was so impressed that I decided to join them and make this thing.

## What will it do?

It's basically a small keyboard, I designed it for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ppy/osu">osu</a>, with zxc keys and some moving button, and also a switch mode button to make it expandable.
